## Daily Rewards Configuration

All rewards could be customized over the configuration file under `config/daily_rewards_common.toml`.

### Preview reward data

You can preview the configured rewards for each month based on the configuration over the `/DailyRewards preview ...` command.
Example: `DailyRewards preview April`

Please keep in mind that the preview could be different from the actually result if you haven't define a reward for each single day.

### Reset reward data

If you want to reset the rewards for the current month, the easiest way is to delete the reward data files inside your world folder under:

- `data/daily_rewards_user.dat`
- `data/daily_rewards.dat`

Alternative you could use an NBT editor to directly edit the files for a specific day.
After the change you need to restart the server, to re-calculate the current daily rewards based on your configuration.

## Internal Data Structure

This section covers the internal data structure used inside the corresponding .dat files.

## Using with Quark 1.16.5

The inventory sort feature from Quark 1.16.5 is not handling the corresponding slot information correctly like locked slots.
This could be miss-used to cheat, for this reason you should deactivate the feature or adding the following change to your `quark-common.toml` file:

```toml
  #A list of screens that don't play well with quark's buttons. Use "Print Screen Classnames" to find the names of any others you'd want to add.
  "Ignored Screens" = ["de.markusbordihn.dailyrewards.client.screen.RewardScreen"]
```
